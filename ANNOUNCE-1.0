The Olena Team is proud to announce the release of Olena 1.0.

Olena is a platform dedicated to image processing and pattern
recognition.  Its core component is a generic and efficient C++
library called Milena.  Milena provides a framework to implement
simple, fast, safe, reusable and extensible image processing tool
chains.  The library provides many ready-to-use image data structures
(regular 1D, 2D, 3D images, graph-based images, etc.) and algorithms.
Milena's algorithms are built upon classical entities from the image
processing field (images, points/sites, domains, neighborhoods, etc.).
This design allows image processing developers and practitioners to
easily understand, modify, develop and extend new algorithms while
retaining the core traits of Milena: genericity and efficiency.

The package also features Swilena, an optional component exposing
Milena to other languages thanks to the Simplified Wrapper and
Interface Generator (SWIG).  For the moment, only some Python bindings
are provided.

The Olena platform is Free Software.  It is distributed under the
conditions of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.  See the
file COPYING shipped with the Olena distribution.

Here is a list of major changes since Olena 0.11:

  * The core C++ library, renamed to Milena, has been rewritten from
    scratch and features numerous additions over the past releases.
    Some features have also been dropped or disabled, and some of them
    will be reintegrated in future releases.  The programming
    interface has changed from previous versions, but most programs
    using Olena 0.11 can be adapted to the Olena 1.0 API.

  * Milena uses a simplified version of the SCOOP 2 paradigm
    (informally called SCOOP 1.5), to improve the speed of compilation
    and make developing easier while still providing very good
    run-time performances.

  * A first (re)implementation of Swilena featuring Python wrappers
    for a very small subset of Milena is available.  The bundled
    Swilena Python Shell (sps) allows interactive Olena sessions.

  * A reference documentation including a tutorial and a quick
    reference guide have been started.  They do not cover the whole
    Milena library yet.

  * Olena includes some demos and applications using Milena.

The file NEWS, included in the archive, contains a more complete list
of user-visible changes.
