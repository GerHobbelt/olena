* files

** bool.hh

create assert.hh from parts of bool.hh

** boolean and bexpr

there is a confusion between mlc::abstract::boolean and the notion of
bexpr (Boolean expression type)!

** value.hh

This file mixes bool_, int_, etc. so I should be split into several
parts and all value-related files should be re-organized.  The current
situation is weird:  internal::value is not in value.hh;  uint.hh does
not define mlc::uint_;  etc.


* renaming

** cmp.hh

eq_ -> equal_ etc.

** comma.hh

mlc_comma_N -> mlc_cmN  (the shorter the better)


* design

** mlc_is_a

It uses wrap_; though, is it really useful?
