* files

** bool.hh

create assert.hh from parts of bool.hh

** boolean and bexpr

there is a confusion between mlc::abstract::boolean and the notion of
bexpr (Boolean expression type)!

** value.hh

This file mixes bool_, int_, etc. so I should be split into several
parts and all value-related files should be re-organized.  The current
situation is weird:  internal::value is not in value.hh;  uint.hh does
not define mlc::uint_;  etc.


* addition

mlc_eval (such as mlc_bool and mlc_value)


* renaming

** cmp.hh

eq_ -> equal_ etc.

** comma.hh

mlc_comma_N -> mlc_cmN  (the shorter the better)


* design

** mlc_is_a

It uses wrap_; though, is it really useful?  the answer seems to be yes.
The code below:

template <typename T>
struct ok : public something< mlc_is_a(T, int) >
{
};

works well and we do not have to write mlc_is_a_ with the '_' at the end
so that's better.   yet is it a direct consequence of the wrapping?

** boolean and bexpr

the last part of the disambiguation between boolean and bexpr is to
remove the inheritance between true_ (resp. false_) and bexpr.

that should lead to:
*** new types
true_expr_ and false_expr_
*** update
concrete bexprs should not be related to true_ and false_
static checks should change
*** remove
eval in true_ and false_
