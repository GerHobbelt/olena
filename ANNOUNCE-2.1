The Olena Team is proud to announce the release of Olena 2.1.

Olena is a platform dedicated to image processing and pattern
recognition.  Its core component is a generic and efficient C++
library called Milena.  Milena provides a framework to implement
simple, fast, safe, reusable and extensible image processing tool
chains.  The library provides many ready-to-use image data structures
(regular 1D, 2D, 3D images, graph-based images, etc.) and algorithms.
Milena's algorithms are built upon classical entities from the image
processing field (images, points/sites, domains, neighborhoods, etc.).
This design allows image processing developers and practitioners to
easily understand, modify, develop and extend new algorithms while
retaining the core traits of Milena: genericity and efficiency.

On top of Milena, the Olena platform also features optional modules
such as Swilena, a component exposing Milena to other languages thanks
to the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG); and the
Scribo module for Document Image Analysis (see below).

The Olena platform is Free Software.  It is distributed under the
conditions of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.  See the
file COPYING shipped with the Olena distribution.

This version is mostly a ``fix-up'' release of Olena 2.0, containing
many corrections and improvements since the previous release.

Here is a list of major changes since Olena 2.0:

  * New and improved algorithms (binarization, skeletonization, layout
    analysis) and I/O routines (PDF, VTK).

  * Minimal support for FFTW 3 (Fast Fourier Transform).

  * The Scribo distribution now contains a Doxygen
    documentation.

  * Support for modern toolchains and especially recent C++ compilers
    (GCC 4.8, Clang 3.5).

The file NEWS, milena/NEWS, scribo/NEWS and swilena/NEWS, included in
the archive, contain a more complete list of user-visible changes.
