The Olena Team is proud to announce the release of Olena 2.0.

Olena is a platform dedicated to image processing and pattern
recognition.  Its core component is a generic and efficient C++
library called Milena.  Milena provides a framework to implement
simple, fast, safe, reusable and extensible image processing tool
chains.  The library provides many ready-to-use image data structures
(regular 1D, 2D, 3D images, graph-based images, etc.) and algorithms.
Milena's algorithms are built upon classical entities from the image
processing field (images, points/sites, domains, neighborhoods, etc.).
This design allows image processing developers and practitioners to
easily understand, modify, develop and extend new algorithms while
retaining the core traits of Milena: genericity and efficiency.

On top of Milena, the Olena platform also features optional modules
such as Swilena, a component exposing Milena to other languages thanks
to the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG); and the
SCRIBO module for Document Image Analysis (see below).

The Olena platform is Free Software.  It is distributed under the
conditions of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.  See the
file COPYING shipped with the Olena distribution.

Here is a list of major changes since Olena 1.0:

  * The biggest addition to Olena available in this new version is the
    SCRIBO module for Document Image Analysis (DIA).  This module has
    been developed in the context of the SCRIBO project (see
    http://www.scribo.ws).  The SCRIBO module provides software
    building blocks to create DIA tool chains, including routines for
    preprocessing steps (such as binarization, show-through removal,
    deskew and denoising), text lines identification, non-text objects
    retrieval (tables, pictures, separators, etc.), line
    reconstruction (rebuilding separators and tables), Optical
    Character Recognition (OCR) integration and document
    reconstruction (converting a document to XML, PDF and/or HTML
    outputs).  Dedicated data structures are also provided to handle
    intermediate results.  Some Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    programs based on the Qt toolkit are also proposed.

  * Several compilation issues have been addressed.

  * New algorithms (especially in mathematical morphology), canvases
    (or algorithmic patterns) and efficient algorithm variants have
    been added to Milena, as well as some new data types (see NEWS for
    more details).

  * More conversion routines, especially regarding color values.

  * Support for I/O routines (both built-in and depending on
    third-party packages) has been improved.

  * Various bug fixes and improvements.

The file NEWS, included in the archive, contains a more complete list
of user-visible changes.
