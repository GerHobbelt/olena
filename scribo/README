 Introduction to Scribo
=======================

Scribo aims to provide tools for Document Image Analysis (DIA).


========
 Content
========

demo/

  viewer/
	GUI for analyzing a document and save it as PDF or HTML.

  xml2doc/
  	Command line tool to convert a document image and its
	content analysis to PDF or HTML.

     Various small tools related to DIA. See src/README.


============
Dependencies
============

In order to use all the features provided by Scribo, the following
dependencies should be installed :

- Qt 4.x
- xsltproc
- fop
- GraphicsMagick++ or ImageMagick++
- Tesseract 2.x or 3.01 minimum (strongly recommended)

Warning: Tesseract 2.x is still supported however, you may encounter
crashes because of bugs with Tesseract and specific locales. Moreover,
results quality is far from what it can be expected with version
3.x. Thus, we strongly advise you to use Tesseract 3.x if possible.


============
KNOWN ISSUES
============

- Tesseract 2.x may cause crashes with specific system locales. It is
  fixed in Tesseract 3.x

- From Tesseract 3.00 to 3.01 API has changed, introducing
  incompatibilities. We chose to be compatible with the latest version.
  Hence, Scribo will not compile with Tesseract 3.00.

- Apple's GCC (llvm-{gcc,g++} 4.2) compiler provided with Mac OS X
  Lion (10.7.0) has some trouble with strict aliasing and our code. If
  you encounter any crashes or strange behaviors, try compiling with
  -fno-strict-aliasing flag.

- On Mac OS X Lion (10.7.0) prefer using GraphicsMagick++ instead of
  ImageMagick++. The latter may cause crashes.
