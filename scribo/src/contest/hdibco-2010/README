Handwritten Document Image Binarization Contest

* Description
In H-DIBCO 2010 (Handwritten Document Image Binarization Contest), the
general objective is to record recent advances in handwritten document
image binarization using established evaluation performance
measures. We will create a benchmarking dataset that is representative
of the potential problems which are challenging in the binarization
process and use a common evaluation platform in order to test and
compare the submitted algorithms for handwritten document image
binarization.
