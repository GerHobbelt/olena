* Contest
Document Analysis Algorithm Contributions in End-to-End Applications

* Description
This contest aims to provide a metric giving indications on the
influence of individual specific document analysis tools to overall
end-to-end applications. Contestants are provided with a full, working
pipeline operating on a raw document page image and proceeding to
extract some final information. The pipeline is built with clearly
identified analysis stages (e.g. binarization, skew detection, layout
analysis, OCR ...) that have a formalized input and
output. Contestants are invited to contribute their own algorithms as
an alternative to one or more of the initially provided stages and
evaluation will be done on the overall impact of the contributed
algorithm to the final (end of pipeline) result.
