* Renaming

** point_accessibility

Rename oln/core/abstract/image/accessibility
into   oln/core/abstract/image/point_wise_accessibility;
rename structures as well, and adjust clients.

** lvalue vs wvalue

Rename lvalue (``left value'') as wvalue (``writable value'')?
(Recall that rvalue can stand for either ``right-value'' or ``readable
value'', even if the latter makes more sense).

Or even, rename rvalue and lvalue as ro_value (read-only) and rw_value
(read-write).
