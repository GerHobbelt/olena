introduce grids


* adds-on

** abstractions

Function_i2i
Weighted_Window

** types

value::proxy to dispatch read/write + the corresponding image type
a mean_value object { sum; count } and operator+
t_image to "transpose" the 0 and the i-th coordinates
image defined by f/pset

** extensions

in Fast_Image: memcpy and memset-like methods (?)
.offset() into GenPixel
built-in op objects -> reverse lhs/rhs


* renaming

mlc into metal
+ look for "same_grid" etc.


* clean-up

accu::histo and median: remove inheritance
select_function in fun::internal::selector_p2? etc.


* processing routines

reconstructions + their canvases
fast versions of level::fill and level::paste
histogram class
sorting points w.r.t. their value (array of offsets, psites, points)
arith::inplace_plus et al.
linear:: for convolutions
