Contents:

graph.hh: CAG building function.
get_line.hh: Extract lines from CAG.
superpose.hh: Draw results on top of an image (from watershed superpose).
main.cc: Demo program.


Usage:

make
./main mypic.tif
display ima_spp.ppm

Refer to main.cc for an example on how to use the functions.
Refer to *.hh files for a short description of the algorithm used.


Results:

The suggested algorithm works, but some cases are not handled properly, e.g:

 1  ___
   /   \
---  2  ---
   \___/
 3

Results are imperfect (see output images).


How to build:

Create a script called make.sh (ignored by git), with the following
content:

#! /bin/sh

make CCOPTS="-I/work/olena-3654/include"

Adjust CCOPTS to fit your system.
