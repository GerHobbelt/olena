== Dilation and erosion==

Dilation and erosion: how to make a k-rank filter when it already exists:

We developed those algorithms in erosion-n.hh and dilation-n.hh.
You can test those by running main_dilation-n.cc.


== Main morpho work ==

The code is located in morpho.cc. You can run it by following those steps:
- type ./configure in the shell
- then make
- then ./run.sh <input_image.pbm> <output_image.pgm>

The input image has to be reverted, meaning that the background has to
be black and the foreground white.

You can customize the input variables by editing the run.sh script.
