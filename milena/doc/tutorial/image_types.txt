** about domain and destination

ima.domain is usually a mathematical set.  Yet it can be a
multiset (a bag) but then weird things might happen...

ima.destination is a set.  Every value, that is ima(p) with p in
ima.domain, is taken from this set.  For instance, a color image can
be defined with the destination being of type value::set<rgb_3x8>.

Classically, some image types are defined by couples (p,v) where v =
ima(p).  A given cell, location in RAM or in a file, corresponds to a
point p and stores the corresponding value.  So when we have N points,
we also have N value cells.  To iterate over pixel values, we then
iterate over the definition domain and access values through ima(p):

code A)
  for all p of ima.domain
  | v = ima(p)
  | print v.

The set of possible taken values in ima is the destination set.  If
this set has a reasonable size, we can iterate over:
 
code B)
  for all v of ima.destination
  | print v.

Sometimes, the number of value cells is much less than the number of
points.  To access the image values, it is more efficient to iterate
over those cells:

code C)
  for all v of ima.values
  | print v.

For such image types, we have several points (sites) associated with a
single value cell.  It is rather different from having couples (p,v);
we actually have one value cell -> a set of points.  Such data
structure allows for compressing data because each value cell is
shared by several points.

*** Example 1

Consider for instance the following image:

+-----+
| 2   |
|  111|
|  22 |
+-----+

We have one value per run.

The value type is int_u2 (unsigned integer on 2 bit), that is, the
type of the interval [0,3] of N.  The image is defined by a run-length
encoding with a single value per run.  Precisely, this image is:

{ ((a,1),2), ((b,3),1), ((c,2),2) }
    ^^^  ^
1st run  |
        value of the 1st run

where a, b, and c designate the respective starting point of each run:

+-----+
| a   |
|  b  |
|  c  |
+-----+

It leads to:
  code A) 211122  because we browse points
  code B) 0123    because we browse [0,3]N
and with :
  code C) 212     because we browse the image value cells;
                  those cells are depicted below.
                           v          v          v
                  { ((a,1),2), ((b,3),1), ((c,2),2) }

**** A clue?

***** part 1

When we have value cells, it is usually related to the fact that the
image is not point-wise writable.  For instance, with the image type
having one value per run, the operation "ima(p) := v" is not possible.
Otherwise, that would mean that a run is split on such a write access,
which is too slow (thus not allowed).

Some rare image types can be both point-wise writable and value cell
iterable.  For instance:

  image<int_u8> data;
  map<int_u8, rgb_3x8> lut; // with i != j => lut[i] != lut[j]
  map<rgb_3x8, int_u8> reverse_lut;

The keys, resp. the values, of the lut are the values, resp. the keys,
of the reverse_lut.  With this structure, we can have a rather efficient
point-wise writable image.

ima(p) <- v {
  it <- reverse_lut.find(v)
  if (it is not found)
     ++n
     lut(n) <- v
     reverse_lut(v) <- n
     data(p) <- n
  else
    data(p) <- it.key
}

***** part 2

When an image is value-wise writable, we can form:
  ima.value(red) = blue;
It means that we can quickly access to the cell (or the cells)
having the value 'red'.

When an image is value-cell writable, we can have:
  for v in ima.values()
    ima.cell(v) = v'
In that case, a 'v' is a value cell, not a value.

***** part 3

Is the notion of value-wise readable relevant?
  ima.value(red) // read-access
gives:
   - red, which is dummy!
or - the corresponding point set, which can be great!

This is another property...


*** Example 2

Consider this image type:

{ data =
    +-----------+
    | 0 2 1 0 2 |
    | 0 0 3 2 1 |
    | 2 1 2 2 0 |
    +-----------+;
  lut =
    +---+---------------+
    | 0 | (255,  0,  0) |  red (r)
    | 1 | (127,127,127) |  medium grey (m)
    | 2 | (  0,  0,255) |  blue (b)
    | 3 | (127,127,127) |  medium grey (m) again
    +---+---------------+
}

This image is defined with a look-up table; its external
representation actually is:

    +-----------+
    | r b m r b |
    | r r m b m |
    | b m b b r |
    +-----------+

(conversely, the internal representation is the 'data' image.)

We have I::value == rgb_3x8
so the image appears to be highly quantized (24 bit).

Yet the number of possible values is limited (here up to 4, even if
two value cells are identical) and stored by the image in the look-up
table.

It leads to:
  code A) rbmrbrrmbmbmbbr
  code B) rmb
  code C) rmbm

ima.destination (browsed by code B) is an instance of
value::subset<rgb_3x8>.

FIXME: OR (?)

It leads to:
  code A) rbmrbrrmbmbmbbr
  code B) impossible because 24bit data
  code C) rmbm

and I.destination gives value::set<rgb_3x8>.

**** primary

Image type instantiable at the first place (without any prior image
being defined).

**** morpher

Image type that relies on another image type or on several
ones; it looks like M<I>.  In the following, ima' (of type I') is a
morpher instance where ima (of type I) is the underlying pre-existing
image.

**** domain_morpher

A morpher that only changes the definition domain;
we have ima'.domain != ima.domain but I'::value == I::value and
for all p in ima'.domain inter ima.domain, ima'(p) == ima(p).

The resulting domain can be larger or smaller than the first one.

FIXME: What about changing only the "extended domain" (via modifying
the behavior of owns_)?

**** value_morpher

A morpher that only changes the values; we have ima'.domain ==
ima.domain but the function ima' is different from ima because either
some values change (for some p, ima'(p) != ima(p)) or the type of
values change.

**** identity_morpher

A morpher that does not change the domain nor the values.
So ima'.domain == ima.domain and for all p, ima'(p) == ima(p).
