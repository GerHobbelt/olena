* Milena 2.1	July 8, 2014

	* New algorithms:
	  - mln::topo::skeleton::priority_driven_thinning.

	* New routines:
	  - mln::geom::crop,
	  - mln::geom::crop_without_localization (image cropping).
	  - mln::data::compute_in_window (accumulator-based
	    computation using a sliding window).
	  - mln::pw::bind (point-wise function binding).

	* New I/Os functions:
	  - mln::io::pdf::load (Poppler-based implementation).
	  - mln::io::vtk::load, mln::io::vtk::save (preliminary
	    built-in implementations).

	* New tracing mechanism (mln_trace).

	* Improve extensibility of mln::convert::from_to.

	* Speed up I/O accesses with ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick.

	* Minimal support for FFTW 3 (Fast Fourier Transform).

	* Rename methods 'point_at_index', 'delta_index' and
	  'index_of_point' as 'point_at_offset', 'delta_offset' and
	  'offset_of_point'.

	* Completely replace mln::morpho::meyer_wst with
	  morpho::watershed::flooding.

	* Demonstrate various examples of image morphers in
	  milena/apps/morphers.

	* Demonstrate various examples of 2D and 3D skeletonizations
	  (thinnings) in milena/apps/generic-skel.

	* Demonstrate various examples of curvature-based thinnings
	  using 2- and 1-collapses in milena/apps/mesh-segm-skel.
