Concerning the xml widget :
	- Can modify in real time the proxy with a regular expression. When the user click on a check box in the region widget, a new regular expression is created an sent to the xml widget but the proxy is not modified by this regular expression.
	- In the table tree (the attributes tree), set the max of the header splitter. Currently it can be moved indefinitely to the right.
	- Fit the splitter to the content of the first column when an attributes node is loaded.
	- My be some color corresponding to the graphics item of the scene.


Concerning the scene :
	- Give the possibility to the user to remove some region.
	- Can create/ fusion some region : sometimes two line regions are splitted but will not be.
	- Optimize the collision between the rectangle item and the regions. Currently it do not take into account if the region is visible by the view before calculating the collision.
	- Use OpenGL to speed up graphics rendering (the gui has been developped with Qt 4.7, OpenGL was still experimental so it was really slow when updating the scene).
	- May be give the possibility to change the color.


Concerning the region widget :
	- As stated bove, connect this widget with the xml widget.
	- Find a better way to get region names and color.


Concerning xml file :
	- Stop using the static array representation of the internal data structure for graphics region.
	- find a better way to run through all node representing a graphics item without knowing it in advance.	For exemple, the xml file looks like this :



						-Metadata
							|- ...
							|- ...
							|- ... Some informations about the creator etc...
						-Page
							|- TextRegion

								|- Coords
							
									|- Points
								...	...

								|- Line

									|- Coords

										|- Points
										...
									...			<---- All the graphical stuff is here.
								...

							|- VerticalSeparatorRegion

								|- Coords

									|- Points
									...
								...
							...


	Graphical items are after pages and node containing informations looks like : *Region -> Coords -> Points and is located in the root node named "Page" so there is a way to find graphical item without knowing their location and name before.



Concerning tool bar :
	- Create icons to replace text.
	- Add new functionnalities.
