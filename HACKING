Developer's Guide
=================

This file gathers some useful information for Olena developers and
contributors.


-------------
Bootstrapping
-------------

If you are fetching Olena from its Git repository, you will need to
run `bootstrap' to build files that are not recorded in the
repository::

        ./bootstrap

By default, `bootstrap' does not regenerate files that are stored on
the repository.  If you want to refresh them (e.g., because your
working copy is in a bad state), you can ask boostrap to regenerate
them::

        ./bootstrap --regen

On a configured tree, you can also use Make to perform the same task::

        make regen


-----------------
Required Software
-----------------

In addition to the required packages listed in README, you may need
the following extra programs if you want to work on the Olena project.

   * If you want to make changes anywhere within the project, you will
     need:

        - GNU Autoconf 2.61

        - GNU Automake 1.10

        - GNU Libtool 1.5.22

   * If you plan to make changes within Swilena, you must have:

        - SWIG 1.3.36

        - Python 2.5

   * If you want to change and/or rebuild the documentation, the
     following tools are required:

        - Doxygen 1.5.6

        - a fairly recent LaTeX distribution

        - the `listings' LaTeX package

        - the `convert' utility from ImageMagick

        - TeX4ht, to compile the LaTeX documentation into HTML

        - dvipng (required by TeX4ht)


Note that `bootstrap' checks for the presence of most of these tools.
