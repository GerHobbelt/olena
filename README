 Introduction to Olena
=======================

Olena_, a platform dedicated to image processing.

.. _Olena: http:://olena.lrde.epita.fr


Overview
========

Olena is a platform dedicated to image processing. At the moment it is
mainly composed of a C++ library: Milena. This library features many
tools to easily perform image processing tasks. Its main
characteristic is its genericity: it allows to write an algorithm once
and run it over many kinds of images (grey scale, color, 1D, 2D, 3D,
...).

Olena is a project developed by the `EPITA Research and Development
Laboratory (LRDE)`__ since 1997.  We did numerous prototypes and
throwaway experiments before settling into the kind of programming
paradigm which is finally here.

__ http://www.lrde.epita.fr

We do our image processing research using this library, but most
importantly we have gathered (and still do) generic programming
expertise from the library development.

Yet, Olena is an ongoing development project. Few algorithms or
definitions may change in a near future. A list of potential changes
is maintained here :
https://olena.lrde.epita.fr/FeaturesSubjectToChange.

Likewise, the documentation does not cover the whole project yet. In the
`doc/' directory you will find the first draft of a reference
manual. It includes a quick reference guide and a tutorial. This is a
good start.  In `milena/tools' and `milena/doc/examples' few sample
programs are available. Most of them are already used to illustrate
the tutorial.  For the rest, we're afraid you will have to dig the
code or e-mail us.

   Please direct any question or comments to <olena@lrde.epita.fr>, or
<olena-bugs@lrde.epita.fr>.

   Olena also has a web page, located at

Installation
============

To install Olena on your system, type in the classical sequence at
the command prompt::

	./configure
	make
	make install (as root)

Note that an installation is  specific to the compiler used to install
it. Indeed, the call  to ``./configure`` enables some workarounds and,
consequently,  users must  compile  with the  same  compiler to  avoid
compatibility problems.

Between ``make`` and ``make install``, you may also want to run::

	make check

 ``make check`` will run the test suite to check the whole library.
Running the test suite may require up several hours.


Please read the INSTALL file for more information about building and
installing Olena.


Additional features
-------------------

Python bindings are provided thanks to Swilena. It is disabled by
default because it requires extra dependencies: Swig. To enable the
compilation of this module use::

       ./configure --enable-swilena


Sample tools are shipped in the tarball. To enable the compilation of
       these tools use:: ./configure --enable-tools


Sample applications are shipped in the tarball. To Enable the
compilation of these applications use::

       ./configure --enable-apps


To read/write TIFF images with Olena, libtiff is required. To specify
the base directory, use::

       ./configure --with-tiff=/path/to/basedir


To read/write GDCM images with Olena, libgdcm is required. To specify
the base directory, use::

       ./configure --with-gdcm=/path/to/basedir



Layout of the tarball
---------------------

The Olena project directory layout is as follows:

build-aux
   Auxialiary tools used by the GNU Build System during ``configure``
   and ``make`` stages.

external
   Sources of Shipped dependencies.


m4
   Portability macros from the ``gnulib`` library.

  apps
     Application examples.

  mln
     Header of the Milena library.

  tests
     The test suite.

  doc
     The documentation.

  tools
     Example tools.

  mesh
     Mesh images.

  img
     Test images.

Requirements
============

Olena has been tested on the following configurations:

System                   Compiler
Linux                    g++ 3.3, 3.4, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2
			 icc 10.1, 11.0
Linux-64 		 g++ 4.1
MacOS X                  g++ 4.0.1


According to the wanted features, some dependencies may be required:


To enable I/O with TIFF images, `libtiff`_ must be installed.

.. _libtiff: http://www.libtiff.org/

To enable I/O with GDCM images, `libgdcm`_ must be installed.

.. _libgdcm: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gdcm/


To support many image formats in Olena's I/O system, `libmagick++`_ must
be installed.

.. _libmagick++: Please see your distribution package manager.


`Boost`_ may be needed if you want to support tuple accumulators.

.. _Boost: http://www.boost.org/
