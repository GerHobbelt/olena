Abstract
********

This is a public testing version of Olena, a generic image processing
library in C++.

   Please read the files INSTALL for information about building and
installing Olena.

   Olena is a project developed by the EPITA Research and Development
Laboratory (<http://www.lrde.epita.fr>) since 1997.  We did numerous
prototypes and throwaway experiments before settling into the kind of
programming paradigm which is finally here.

   The documentation does not cover the whole project yet. In the `doc/'
directory you will find the first draft of a reference manual. It
includes a quick reference guide and a tutorial. This is a good start.
In `milena/tools', `milena/doc/tutorial/samples' and `milena/doc/examples'
few sample programs are available. Most of them are already used to
illustrate the tutorial.
For the rest, we're afraid you will have to dig the code or e-mail us.

   Please direct any question or comments to <olena@lrde.epita.fr>, or
<olena-bugs@lrde.epita.fr>.

   Olena also has a web page, located at
<http://www.lrde.epita.fr/Olena>.
